### What I learned

First time using Grid, its quite challenging to use grid over flexbox. By learning and knowing there is a another way to achive layout that i wanted using Grid, It makes me go deep enought to the design to decide whether to use grid or just using Flexbox. From what i learn, i think Grid is good to use if the layout is well structure.

What do you guys think about Grid? and what thought process until you decide to use grid rather then flexbox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I think i still need to learn more about the grid, because i still not yet understand enough, especially to move around the content within the grid. And also other properties about the grid
